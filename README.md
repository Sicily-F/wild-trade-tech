# Exploring the role of technology in tackling illegal wildlife trade: a use case of mobile AI species identification technology to address the Southeast Asian illegal bird trade​ 

The following repository is part of an open development process of a wildlife marketplace technologyran by [Sicily Fiennes](https://biologicalsciences.leeds.ac.uk/biological-sciences/pgr/1934/sicily-fiennes), a PhD student in the [Extinction Studies Doctoral Training Program](https://extinctionstudiesdtp.leeds.ac.uk/) at the University of Leeds. 

My project title is: 'Opportunities for co-design of technology to address the Southeast Asian illegal bird trade'. My doctoral research focuses on legal and illegal songbird trade in Asia and building machine learning tools to optimize species identification in markets. The main project is a machine learning-driven image recognition tool for species for use in bird markets in East Asia, targeted at law enforcement. I also seek to understand factors that influence the adoption and implementation of wildlife marketplace technologies amongst law enforcement and how this interacts with the risk of extinction of songbirds. I am also interested in opportunities for the co-creation of technology and decolonizing design methods. 

This repository acts as a live record of my progress on this project, including the use of Microsoft Azure computing credits, via a grant from Microsoft’s AI For Earth. This grant is being used to process data, run models, and design user interfaces.
